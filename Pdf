Anchor: Without wasting much of our time, I'll like to ask my guest here today to tell us move about Climate change the causes and effects and what is likely to be the Solutions to

guest It Thank you very much, I'm Pretty sure we all have heard about the word

climate change. It refers to a long term shift in temperature and changes in


Weather Pattern, it maybe natural but since 1800's human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which Produce heat -trapping gases. Manufacturing and industry Produce emission mostly from burning fossil Fuel to produce energy for making things like Cement, iron, Steel, electronics, Plastics, clothes and Other industrial process also release gas, cutting downs of forest trees to Crate farms or Pastures for other reason cutting down emission is the process production and discharge of gas or radiation of

Guest 2: About Human activity are the main Causes of climate Change people burn fossil fuels and when fossil fuel are burned they release large amount of Carbon oxide, a greenhouse gas into air and greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming, in Nigerian gases From vehicles like Cars lorries, Ships emits greenhouse gases such as sulphur dioxide and Carbon monoxide From their exhaust. The Changes has a lot of effects to the would especially causing havoc on the health of human being and the creatures in it, Changing Weather Pattern are expanding diseases and nearly all land area are seeing move hot days and heat waves, 2020 Was One of the most hottest year on record also higher temperature in creases the risks of heat related disease and when the temperature is hotter it is move difficult to work and move around, wild can easily and spread rapidly and it leads to death of many innocent lives and lost of properties water is becoming move scarce In move region and droughts can Stir up destructive Sand and dust storms, deserts are expanding and it reducing land For growing foods. J

Muises Backyard frees in 3: climate Change is a threat to millions of lives here are some solutions to it, from renewable energy to limiting deforestation

In 2015, world leaders signed a major treaty called the Parts agreement, reducing greenhouse gas emission which must get to Zero as soon as possible because both forest and oceans play vitally important roles in regulating our climate, increasing the natural ability of forests, and Oceans to absorb carbon dioxide can also help stop global warming.

(1) We must keep fossil fuels in the ground all countries need to move their

economies away from fossil fuel and as soon as possible.

âš« invest in renewable energy: Changing our main energy is the best way to stop fossil fuel. These include technologies like Solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal Power

Switch to sustainable transport petrol, diesel vehicles, Planes and ships use fossil fuels, reducing can use switching to electric vehicle and minimising plane travel it will reduce air Pollution 100

improve Farming and encourage vegan diets

Reduce how much People consume and Reduce plastic, and demand for Plastic is missing so quickly that Creating and disposing of plastic will accounts for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050 (this is the emission count me need to stay within according to the Paris agreement)

Anchor thank you so much for telling us and expanciating the meaning of

Climate Change the cause, effect and solutions

I believe all our listeners has know move about climate Changes without wasting much of our time, we will move to the next segment which is question and answer, I know our listeners will have one or two questions to ask, so we will call our caving number out

Caller I good day my amiable presenter, any appreciate all you do. God bless you, what are the main causes of Climate Change Guest 2: The Main causes of Climate are human activities such as burning

Fossil Fuels, deforestation and other industrial processes.

Anchor so we will move to the next questions

Caller 2: good day my Presenter. How does Climate change affect our environment?

Guest 1: Climate change affect the environment by causing move frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and ice craps and Changes in Plant and animal behaviour

Anchor thank you so much that is all tow today's Program. I appreciate our guest of honour and everyone listening out there, thanks for making time to come to our talk snow, we will be ending our program today. Still remain your amiable Presenter Bolarinwa Shuqroh Adeola
